# course_postgresql_advanced_queries

My own docker compose environment in order to follow this training: [postgresql-advanced-queries course on LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/postgresql-advanced-queries).

```Shell
docker compose up -d --build
```

## What was new to me

### c1 Summary statistics by grouping

```SQL
GROUP BY CUBE (/* col, ... */)
GROUP BY ROLLUP (/* col, ... */)
bool_and(/* col */)
bool_or(/* col */)
stddev_pop(/* col */)
stddev_samp(/* col */)
var_pop(/* col */)
var_samp(/* col */)
/* aggregate function */ FILTER (WHERE /* condition */) AS /* "name" */
```

### c2 Window functions

* Window function: window frame showing the total result in every individual row instead of reducing rows to one for the whole group.

```SQL
/* aggregate function */ OVER()
```

* Partition row segmented: the result corresponding to the chosen col group is shown in every individual row.

```SQL
/* aggregate function */ OVER(PARTITION BY /* col */) AS /* "name" */
```

* Streamline partition queries with a WINDOW clause: avoid repeating PARTITION several times

```SQL
/* aggregate function */ OVER(/* col */)
FROM /* table */
WINDOW /* name */ AS (PARTITION BY /* col */)
```

* Acumulate results

```SQL
/* aggregate function */ OVER(ORDER BY /* col */) AS /* "name" */
```

* Sliding window

```SQL
/* aggregate function */ OVER(ORDER BY /* col */ ROWS BETWEEN /* begin */ PRECEDING AND /* end */ FOLLOWING) AS /* "name" */
```

* Return a value evaluated against the first row in a sorted partition of a result set.

```SQL
FIRST_VALUE(expression) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_expression, ... ]
    ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC], ...
)
```

* Return a value evaluated against the last row in a sorted partition of a result set.

```SQL
LAST_VALUE(expression) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_expression, ... ]
    ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC], ...
)
```

### c3 Statistics on sorted data

* Median (note that average is something different, it is just sum/n)

```SQL
PERCENTILE_DISC(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY /* col */) AS "discrete median",
PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY /* col */) AS "continuous median"
```

* First and third quartiles

```SQL
PERCENTILE_CONT(.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY /* col */) AS "1st quartile"
PERCENTILE_CONT(.50) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY /* col */) AS "2nd quartile"
PERCENTILE_CONT(.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY /* col */) AS "3rd quartile"
```

* Divide ordered rows in a partition into a specified number of ranked groups, which are as equal in size as possible. These ranked groups are called buckets.

```SQL
NTILE(buckets) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_expression, ...]
    [ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC], ...]
)
```

### c4 Ranking

* Assign a rank to each row within a partition of the result set.

```SQL
RANK() OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_expression, ... ]
    ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC], ...
)
```

* Evaluate the relative standing of a value within a set of values.

```SQL
PERCENT_RANK() OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_expression, ... ]
    ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC], ...
)
```

* Assign a rank to every row in each partition of a result set. Unlike the RANK() function, DENSE_RANK() always returns consecutive rank values. Both RANK() and DENSE_RANK() will return the same rank given the same input values.

```SQL
DENSE_RANK() OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_expression, ... ]
    ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC], ...
)
```

* Return the relative position of a value in a set of values (the row's sorted position, divided by the number of rows in the data set).

```SQL
CUME_DIST() OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_expression, ... ]
    ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC], ...
)
```

### c5 Output values with conditions

* Conditions.

```SQL
CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    ...
    ELSE resultN
END
```

* Merge multiple columns into a single value. It returns the first non-null value from a list of expressions.

```SQL
SELECT
    description,
    COALESCE(string_agg(CAST(id AS VARCHAR), ','), '') AS ids
FROM table
GROUP BY description;
```

* Compares two expressions. If the two expressions are equal, it returns NULL. Otherwise, it returns the first expression.

```SQL
NULLIF(expression1, expression2)
```

### More techniques

* Assigns a unique integer value to each row returned by a query.

```SQL
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
    [PARTITION BY column_1, column_2, ...]
    [ORDER BY column_3, column_4, ...]
)
```

* Cast function and cast operator.

```SQL
CAST(value AS target_type);
value::target_type
```

* Access to data from the next/previous row in the table. Can be used to move rows for instance.

```SQL
LEAD(expression [, offset [, default_value]]) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_expression, ...]
    ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC], ...
)
LAG(expression [, offset [, default_value]]) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_expression, ...]
    ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC], ...
)
```

* Creating a series of values within a specified range. Itâ€™s commonly used for generating sequences of numbers, dates, or timestamps.

```SQL
generate_series(start, stop, [step/interval])
```

* Series of timestamps.

```SQL
generate_series(
    '2008-03-01 00:00'::timestamp,
    '2008-03-04 12:00',
    '10 hours'
)
```

* Regular expressions: `'input string' [match operator] [character sequence]`

* Regular Expression Match Operators:
  * `~` string case sensitive
  * `~*` string case insensitive
  * `!~` excludes string case sensitive
  * `!~*` excludes string case insensitive

* Regular Expression Character Sequences:
  * `~ 'abc'` matches to the string 'abc' only: 'abcd', 'xabcy'
  * `~ 'c.t' .` matches any single character: 'cat', 'cot', but not 'coat'
  * `~ '(at|an)' | inside ( )` indicates OR: will match 'boat', 'plane', but not 'train'
  * `~ '[abc]' [ ]` defines a character set: 'cat', 'boy', but not 'dog'
  * `~ '^a' ^` anchors the pattern to the start: 'apple', but not 'banana'
  * `~ 'a$' $` anchors the pattern to the end: 'banana', but not 'apple'
